## [Learning objectives]{.ul}

-   **Summarize and display quantitative data (frequency distributions, bar graphs, and dot charts)**

-   **Summarize and report quantitative data**

-   **Construct a histogram as a graphical summary of quantitative data**

**Frequency Distribution:** A frequency distribution is a tabular summary of the number of observations falling into each of two or more mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive categories.

**Relative Frequency Distribution:** A relative frequency distribution reports the proportion, rather than number, of observations falling into each category.

![](fig1.png "Table: Graduate students' place-of-origin data")

The table (above) shows the graduate students' place-of-origin data. The data is qualitative. Even though the countries could be coded with numbers (e.g., Europe=1, China =2, etc.), yet they are not inherently numerical, and thus can not perform numeral analysis on them. The best way to report the data is to use frequency analysis/ distribution that enable us to categorize, count and compare the data in terms of the country-of-origin.

#### **Lets' prepare the data and perform Frequency Analysis** 

#### Data Preparation

```{r}
#Generate data values
A = c(rep('Latin', 3), rep('Europe', 4), rep('US', 8),rep('India', 10), rep('China', 15))

# review first 8 obervation
head(A,8)

```

```{r}
#display all observations of the data
A
```

| **Country**   | **Frequency** | **Relative frequency** | **Percent frequency** |
|---------------|---------------|------------------------|-----------------------|
| China         | 15            | 15/40 =0.375           | 37.5%                 |
| Europe        | 4             | 4/40 = 0.1             | 10%                   |
| India         | 10            | 10/40 = 0.25           | 25%                   |

| US            | 8             | 8/40 =0.2              | 20%                   |
| Total         | 40            | 1.00                   | 100%                  |

### [Estimation using R]{.ul} 

#### Frequency Distribution

```{r}
# use the 'table' function to quantify the freqeuncies (counts of each categories)
freq=table(A)
freq
```

#### Relative Frequency Distribution

```{r}
# use sum() or length() to find the total number of elements in the data
n=sum(freq)
n=length(A)
n

#Estimating relative frequency of each catagory (country-of-origin) y dividing 'freq' by n

RF=freq/n
RF
```

#### Arrange the results in a table

|               |               |                        |                      |
|---------------|---------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| **Country**   | **Frequency** | **Relative frequency** | **Percent frequncy** |
| China         | 15            | 15/40 =0.375           | 37.5%                |
| Europe        | 4             | 4/40 = 0.1             | 10%                  |
| India         | 10            | 10/40 = 0.25           | 25%                  |
| Latin America | 3             | 3/40 =0.075            | 7.5%                 |
| US            | 8             | 8/40 =0.2              | 20%                  |
| Total         | 40            | 1.00                   | 100%                 |

### [Displaying qualitative data]{.ul}

#### Two graphical methods of displaying qualitative data are (1) bar graph ad (2) dot chart. We will use the data defined earlier stored in the variable 'A'.

**What is a Bar Graph?** A bar graph is a picture displaying qualitative data. Bars representing the different categories are typically placed along a horizontal axis; the heights of the bars drawn above the axis indicate the frequency, relative frequency, or percent frequency for each category.

**What is Dot Chart?** A dot chart is a graphical representation of qualitative data expressed in terms of frequencies (or relative frequencies) of category occurrence.

#### [Create a Bar Chart:]{.ul}

```{r}

# create dataframe and add variable name

# Use the data.frame() function to (a) convert A into a data frame and 
# (b) introduce variable name, ’Region.’ Use head(C2_1, 8)

A <- data.frame(Region = A);
# display first eight elements
head(A,8)

# load the ggpot2 to display the with bar graph and dot chart
library(ggplot2)

# plot bar graph
ggplot(A, aes(Region)) +

       geom_bar(fill = "blue") +

       ggtitle("Bar Graph of Student Origin Data") +

       xlab("Country/Region") +

       ylab("Number of Students")

```

#### [Create a Dot Plot:]{.ul}

Create a dot plot for ploting relative frequency of different countries/nations/ regions using previously created relative frequency data stored in "FE"

```{r}
RF
# plot dot chart ('dotchart' is a built in function; no need to load the 'ggplot2')
dotchart(sort(RF), xlab = "Relative Frequencies of Nation/Region",

         main = 'A Dot Chart of Student Origin Data',

         xlim = c(0,0.40), pch = 19, col = 'black')
```
